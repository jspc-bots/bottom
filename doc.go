// package bottom is an IRC Bot mini-framework (for want of a better word)
//
// It sets up different message handlers for different messages, has the concept of
// middlewares, and exposes everything underneath for when you need just a little
// more control.
//
// It's pretty intuitive, but the examples directory will get you where you need to go
//
// It also makes a series of assumptions, such as SASL, and so may not be right for
// lots of projects.
